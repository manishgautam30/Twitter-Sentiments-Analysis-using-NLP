# Twitter-Sentiments-Analysis-using-NLP

### The objective of this task is to do Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data using natural language processing (NLP), text mining, computational linguistics, and bio measurements to methodically recognize, extricate, evaluate, and examine emotional states and subjective information.

### The basic idea of sentiment investigation is to detect the polarity of text documents or short sentences and classify them on this premise. Sentiment polarity is categorized as “positive”, “negative” or “impartial” (neutral). It is important to highlight the fact that sentiment mining can be performed on three levels as follows:

### 1. Document-level sentiment classification: At this level, a document can be classified entirely as “positive”, “negative”, or “neutral”.

### 2. Sentence-level sentiment classification: At this level, each sentence is classified as “positive”, “negative” or unbiased.

### 3. Aspect and feature level sentiment classification: At this level, sentences/documents can be categorized as “positive”, “negative” or “non-partisan” in light of certain aspects of sentences/archives and commonly known as “perspective-level assessment grouping”.
